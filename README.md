🏋️‍♂️ Barbell Exercise Classifier
This project is a Python-based system for processing and analyzing accelerometer and gyroscope data. It enables the visualization and modeling of motion data to build a machine learning model capable of classifying barbell exercises and counting repetitions.

📌 Features
📊 Data preprocessing of raw accelerometer and gyroscope signals

📈 Data visualization for better insights

🧠 Machine learning model for exercise classification

🔁 Repetition counter for barbell movements

🧪 Evaluation and performance metrics

📊 Dataset
The project uses time-series sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) collected from wearable devices during barbell exercises. The dataset includes various types of exercises and their repetitions.

Dataset source or link can be added here if public.

🤖 Machine Learning
The model is trained to classify different types of barbell exercises using features extracted from motion sensor data. It also includes functionality to count the number of repetitions performed.

📈 Results
Model accuracy: TBD

Confusion matrix and other metrics available in the results/ folder

🔧 Future Improvements
Add support for other types of exercises

Optimize the model for real-time use

Deploy as a web or mobile app
