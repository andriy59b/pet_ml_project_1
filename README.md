# 🏋️‍♂️ Barbell Exercise Classifier

This project is a Python-based system for processing and analyzing accelerometer and gyroscope data. It enables the visualization and modeling of motion data to build a machine learning model capable of classifying barbell exercises and counting repetitions.

## 📌 Features

- 📊 Data preprocessing of raw accelerometer and gyroscope signals  
- 📈 Data visualization for better insights  
- 🧠 Machine learning model for exercise classification  
- 🔁 Repetition counter for barbell movements  
- 🧪 Evaluation and performance metrics

📊 Dataset

The project uses time-series sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) collected from wearable devices during barbell exercises. The dataset includes various types of exercises and their repetitions.

Dataset source or link can be added here if public.
